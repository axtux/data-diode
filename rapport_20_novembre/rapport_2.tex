\section{Introduction}
In recent years, cyber-security has become a primary concern for companies all over the world. No matter the size of the company, data often represent the heart of their business and whether the concern is the secrecy of intellectual property, or users' privacy, the theft of private data bears a huge cost for companies. Be it a monetary cost (lawsuits, fines) or a reputation cost (loss of trust, public outrage). In the case of government agencies, states secrets and other classified information could be stolen by a foreign nation, possibly leading to the loss of lives in conflict zones, loss of political leverage on the international scene, domestic political turmoil and scandals or simply public embarrassment.\\

When trying to protect these sensitive data, a common measure is be to physically isolate the network from the internet, by creating an \textit{air gap}. Acting this way ensures that the data from the network is inaccessible from the outside world. The main issue with this method is that inevitably, some external data or files will at some point need to be imported into the secure network, be it for software update, or simply because some files from the outside are necessary for the people working in the secure network. In that case, a manual import (via USB drive, by connecting an external laptop into the secure network, or by using some other data transfer device) will be necessary.\\

The problem with that method is that it can compromise the security of the secure network. For instance, the data that is manually transferred into the network may have been infected by a malware, or the secure network might already be infected by a virus. In both cases, there is a possibility for some malicious code to exfiltrate data, or to spread a virus outside, by secretly writing on the device that was originally used to import the data into the network, such as USB drives or laptops.\\

As a consequence, we need to build a solution that prevents data leaks while allowing the transfer of files from the outside network into the secure network.

\section{Goals of the project}
\label{sec:goals}
Goals define the general direction of what the organization aims to accomplish, in the long term. Here, we wish to design a system that accomplishes three main goals :

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Create a device that completely prevents the exfiltration of data from a secure network, while allowing data to be transferred from the outside world into that secure network.}
\item{Ensure the availability of the system. The down times should be as minimum as possible.}
\item{Allow specific users to manage and monitor this system through an administration web page.}
\end{enumerate}

In this project, the general solution is imposed and should be a data diode, which will be described in section~\ref{sec:data-diode}.

\section{Scope}
It is important to precisely identify the scope of this project, in relation to our goals and objectives.\\

Our solution is destined to be integrated in an existing system. As such, when considering the security of the system as a whole, we must identify which security aspects fall under our responsibility and which don't. 

\subsection{In scope}
The following elements are in scope, which means that it is our responsibility to make sure that the security of these elements is ensured.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The availability of the service}
\item{The confidentiality of user data and credentials when interacting with the data diode (see section \ref{sec:data-diode})}
\item{The impossibility to exfiltrate data from the secure network}
\item{The integrity of the data pushed through the data diode}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Out of scope}
\label{sec:outscope}
The following elements are out of scope. This means that the security of these elements does not fall under our responsibility, but rather under the responsibility of the client, or another third party.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The physical access to the hardware, such as the power button or Ethernet cables}
\item{The physical integrity of the hardware}
\item{The electrical power source}
\item{The security within the secure network, such as the presence of malwares or other viruses}
\item{The behaviour of the employees allowed to interact with the diode}
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Diode}
\label{sec:data-diode}
To ensure the integrity and the confidentiality of the data within our system and the availability of the service, we are going to implement a \textit{data diode}.\\

Just like an electrical diode only conduct electrical current in one direction, a data diode is a networking device that only allows data to flow in one direction. It is composed of two physical servers: one server communicates with the outside network and the other one communicate with the secure network. The two servers are to one another by a single unidirectional fiber optics cable.\\

A fiber optic connection normally uses two cables: one for each direction. In the case of 	 data diode, only one cable is used, allowing the data to flow in one direction. The cable going in the other direction is physically cut. As a consequence, data going through a data diode can only flow in one direction, which is one of the goals required in section \ref{sec:goals}.\\

The one-way communication channel between the two sides of the data-diode forbids the use of usual TCP based protocols (such as HTTP or FTP), as TCP requires bi-directional communication between two parties. As data between the two sides of the data-diode can only flow in one direction, we need data to be send over a protocol that doesn't require bi-directional communication. This can be done by using UDP for the communication between our two servers.\\

However UDP comes with its own limitations, as it doesn't ensure the order at which the paquets arrive, nor does it manage packets loss. These issues will therefore need to be taken into account at the software level.\\

\end{figure}


\subsection{Applications}
\subsubsection{JSON API}
We propose a JSON API to import files comming from connected devices to a secure network. To push data, a device needs to send a HTTP request to the outside machine with the basic authentication of the protocol in the headers and the JSON file in the body. When the request is received, the outside machine parse the HTTP request into a JSON file and send it with UDP to the secure side server. This machine will then store the file.

\subsubsection{Administration and User Management}
\label{sec:administration}
One of the goals of this project is the creation of a web interface to manage the data-diode. We will implement a web interface on the unsecure side that allows administrators to add new users or new administrators and a second web interface on the secure side that monitors the arrival of the UDP packets and creates an access to the data.

\subsubsection{Mockups}

\end{center}

\end{center}



\subsection{Physical Architecture}
The data-diode is composed of two separate servers connected to each other through a unidirectional fiber optics cable. The server facing the outside network is called \textit{the sender}, the server facing the secure network is called \textit{the receiver}.\\

Each server contains the following components :
\begin{itemize}
\item{Two network interfaces: one for connecting to a network, and one for connecting to the other server}
\item{A fiber optic adapter, to translate the signal coming from the fiber optic cable from light into a signal that can be transmitted through an Ethernet port.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software architecture}
The data-diode is composed of two servers, \textit{the sender} and \textit{the receiver}, which have different roles. 

\subsubsection{The Sender}
The \textit{sender} must be able to receive HTTP requests from the outside network and to transmit JSON files to the \textit{receiver} via UDP.\\

The sender must therefore be comprised of :
\begin{itemize}
\item{A UDP client}
\item{A web server}
\item{A php server}
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{The Receiver}
The \textit{receiver} must be able to receive UDP paquets and reconstruct them as a JSON file that will be placed in a database. \\

In summary, the receiver will contain :
\begin{itemize}
\item{A UDP server}
\item{A web server}
\item{A php server}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulating a data-diode}
At first, instead of using a real data-diode, we are going to build the prototype of a data-diode by simulating the actual system through software. The unidirectional nature of the data transfer will be simulated by modifying the IP table in a way that will allow traffic in one direction, and drop all traffic going in the other direction.


\section{Users}
We identify two types of users : the administrators and the simple users.

\subsection{Simple Users}
Simple users are the data pushers using their connected devices.
\subsection{Administrators}
The role of the administrators is to manage the users and other administrators .
\section{Administration and Management}
\subsubsection{Administration of Simple Users}
Administrators can create and delete user accounts. If a user lost his password, he needs to contact an administrator who will give him a new one.

\subsubsection{Administration of other Administrators}
Administrators are able to create an administrator account, or to suspend the account of another administrator.
\subsection{data-diode Installation and Configuration}
\subsubsection{Installation}
The data-diode is provided to the client with the programs already installed, and a default administrator account. At first use, the password should be modified.
\subsubsection{Configuration}
The data-diode settings will be specified in a configuration file that can be modified manually.
\section{Risk analysis}

\subsection{Countermeasures}
As security has a significative price for a company, we assume that low risks should be accepted.
\subsubsection{Risk 1 : Packet sniffing on the diode}
As the physical access to the diode is out of our scope, we transfer this risk to the client.
\subsubsection{Risk 3 : Deterioration of the diode}
As the physical access to the diode is out of our scope, we transfer this risk to the client.
\subsubsection{Risk 4 : Flooding on the sender}

\subsubsection{Risk 5 : Flooding of the outside webpage}

\subsubsection{Risk 6 : Brute force on outside webpage}
We mitigate this risk by forcing administrators to have a long enough password to make it really hard to brute force.
\subsubsection{Risk 7 : SQL injection on outside webpage}
We avoid this risk by using prepared statement mecanism on the login inputs.
\subsubsection{Risk 8 : UDP packet loss}
We mitigate this risk by pushing 3 times each UDP packets. We then only need one received packet over the three to obtain the data on the secure side.As the chance to have one lost packet is small, the probabilities to have 3 lost packets are nearly null.
\subsubsection{Risk 9 : UDP corrupted packet}
We mitigate this risk with the same techniques than for lost packets but including the UDP checksum. We only need one correct packet over the three to obtain the data on the secure side. The chances to have three corrupted packets are also nearly null.
\subsubsection{Risk 10 : Deletion of user accounts}
As the behaviour and the good will of the employees are under the responsability of the client, we transfer this risk to them.
\subsubsection{Risk 11 : Deletion of administrator accounts}
As the behaviour and the good will of the employees are under the responsability of the client, we transfer this risk to them.
